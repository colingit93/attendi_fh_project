# attendi
The goal of the project is to create an online attendance list, where students can confirm their presence at a course on their mobile phone or computer. The application will provide an interface for students and lecturers. Lecturers will be able to create and manage their courses, add and remove students as well as setting course times. Students will be presented with a list of courses they need to attend and once the course starts, they are able to confirm their presence. Confirming attendance could be confirmed by entering a passphrase provided by the lecturer. The application should only be accessible on the lecturing premises.

| Project Abstract <br />(What is the project about)           | The idea of the project arose from a problem Colin faces every day, he cannot sign the attendance list because he never brings a pen to class.

The application will provide an interface for students and lecturers. Lecturers will be able to create and manage their courses, add and remove students as well as setting course times.
