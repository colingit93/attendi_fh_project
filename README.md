# attendi
The goal of the project is to create an online attendance list, where students can confirm their presence at a course on their mobile phone or computer. The application will provide an interface for students and lecturers. Lecturers will be able to create and manage their courses, add and remove students as well as setting course times. Students will be presented with a list of courses they need to attend and once the course starts, they are able to confirm their presence. Confirming attendance could be confirmed by entering a passphrase provided by the lecturer. The application should only be accessible on the lecturing premises.

| Project Abstract <br />(What is the project about)           | The idea of the project arose from a problem Colin faces every day, he cannot sign the attendance list because he never brings a pen to class. The goal of the project is to create an online attendance list, where students can confirm their presence at a course on their mobile phone or computer. The application will provide an interface for students and lecturers. Lecturers will be able to create and manage their courses, add and remove students as well as setting course times. Students will be presented with a list of courses they need to attend and once the course starts, they are able to confirm their presence. Confirming attendance could be confirmed by entering a passphrase provided by the lecturer. The application should only be accessible on the lecturing premises. |
| USP of the project (How does the project differ from other projects) | The project idea was not inspired any application, we did however find an existing project that is seemingly quite similar.<br/>Existing solution:<br/>MyAT (MyAttendanceTracker.com) -> no detailed information of all features given<br/>The MyAT application differs in that:<br/>• It doesn’t use Angular Framework<br/>• It doesn’t target the FH Joanneum<br/>• No feature to upload absence confirmation documents |
| User Stories (Who, wants what and why?)                      | 1. As lecturer I want to create lectures in my dashboard on a certain date, at a certain time and for specific student groups (classes) to confirm students are attending my course.<br/>2. As a student I want to be able to upload an absence note to inform the lecturer of my absence.<br/>3. As a student I want to see some statistics regarding attendance on my dashboard, so I can quickly assess the progress of attendance.<br/>4. As a student I want I want to see for which courses attendance is mandatory to know which courses I absolutely need to attend.<br/>5. As a student I want to sign the attendance list to confirm my presence at the course. |
